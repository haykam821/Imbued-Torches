Allows applying redstone dust to a torch to make it a redstone torch.

Imbued Torches requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Fabricbridge from [Imbued Torches](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/imbued-torches/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Imbued-Torches/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

Click on a regular torch with redstone dust to convert the torch into a redstone torch. Doing so will consume the redstone dust.

In addition, this mod changes the crafting recipe for the redstone torch to require a normal torch instead of a stick.
